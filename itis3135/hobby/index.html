     <p>
     Welcome to my Hobby page! Here I will share with you 
     my love for cars and sport bikes as well as tools for learning
     how to get into project cars.
     </p>

     <p>With the increasing price of new production cars
     and service, its important to learn services to save
     you a trip to the dealership. This can also save you 
     a lot of time!</p>

     <section id="2" class="tabcontent"><h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>I have been working on cars and motorcycles for 8 years.
     I have worked on cars from the 1950's all the way through the mid
     2010's.</p>

     <p>One of the main things I love about my hobby is watching 
     projects slowly become driveable and useable after periods
     of repair and frustration.</p>

     <section id="3" class="tabcontent"><h3>Selecting a Project Car</h3>
     <p>When it comes to picking a project, many people become
     obsessed with finding the perfect car. This means staying
     glued to facebook marketplace like an addict. In reality, there
     will almost never be a perfect project car. But hey....thats kinda
     the point!</p>

     <p>The best project cars are ones that have a healthy aftermarket
     for parts and are reasonably affordable. Try to find unpopular cars
     before everyone else finds out about them and you can get a good deal!</p>

     <p>Its important to research the car before seeing it in person. The best
     way to tell if it'll be reasonable to work on is by taking a look at the engine bay.
     Older Japanese and American cars generally have much simpler engine bays compared
     to today's messes of wires and sensors. But not all Japanese cars are blessed with
     simple engine bays, just take a look at my 300zx below! One of the first CAD generated motor designs. Yikes.

     <img src="images/300zxBay.png" alt="300zx Engine Bay" width="600">
     <figcaption>Good luck removing all the vacuum lines!</figcaption>
     </figure>
  
     <p>This is exactly why researching your desired project car is so critical. Its why so
     many people flock to early model honda civics and classic cars. Its all about finding a car
     that is approachable and easy to understand and troubleshoot. Here is a small list of cars
     I would recommend for a first time project and why.</p>

     <ul>
     <li>NA Miata (1987-1997)-The aftermarket for this little fun car is constantly
     growing, and there are many build options to take with this car, including track builds, drift builds, etc. Overall,
     the engine is reliable, but suffers from a loosening crankshaft pulley which could cause damage to the serpentine belt.</li>
     
     <li>F-Body muscle cars(Camaro/Firebird/Trans-AM from 1971 to 1981)-After restoring a 1978 camaro, I can safely say it is one of
     the most approachable cars to work on, which is important for new hands. They can be had for a decent price but usually require a good
     bit of elbow grease to get into great shape. One of the best parts about working on a classic car in charlotte is NPD, a parts depot for
     classic cars located just a few minutes outside campus! You can get every piece youd need to restore the car on your own time. I personally
     reupholstered my camaro, had a motor installed, wired a new stereo, installed new fenders, and completely overhauled the interior with new parts and electronics. The list is too 
     long to fit here. Overall, classic cars are great to work on and can be tuned with simple tools, like a screwdriver. </li>
     
     <li>Honda EG hatch (1992-1995)- There is a reason these cars have such a cult following. The hatch came with a few engine options,
     with the D15B being the most widely used platform. This small, 1.5L-2.0L platform has been turbocharged over and over again, and still puts
     smiles on people's faces. It is an extraordinarily reliable platform, owing much to its small displacement and short stroke set-up. For whatever
     reason you get a project car, the eg hatch has what youre looking for, except a V8. </li>
     </ul>
     </section>

     <section id="4" class="tabcontent"><h3>Working on Classic Cars</h3>
     <p>One of the advantages I mentioned previously was ease of maintenance on classic cars.
     This is in part due to their mechanically driven systems. Many aspects of these vehicles
     do not involve the use of electronics at all. For example, carburetors are used instead
     of modern electronic fuel injection. Carburetors use the venturi effect to pull fuel from
     small jets fixed in the body of the carburetor which are connected to fuel bowls fed
     by the engines mechanical fuel pump. What this means is anyone can make adjustments to this
     mechanical system with simple tools. You can adjust the fuel ratio for various conditions,
     such as summer or winter driving, or for racing applications. The engine bays are typically very
     spacious and allow you to visually understand the outer-workings of the engine.</p>

     
    
     <p>Basic maintenance on classic cars includes:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><strong>Checking spark plugs for fouling</strong>- getting gunked up</li>
     <li><strong>Inspecting spark plug wires for corrosion</strong>- Check socket where wire connects to spark plugs</li>
     <li><strong>Checking points in distributor for corrosion</strong>- located inside a large plastic cap typically at backside of engine</li>
     <li><strong>Changing oil at routine intervals</strong>- same procedure as modern cars</li>
     <li><strong>Checking status of coolant</strong>- No sludge or "milkshake" color in radiator</li>
     <li><strong>Checking for oil/coolant leaks</strong>- Very common in older cars regardless of make or model</li>
     <li><strong>Checking amount of brake pad or brake shoe left on each brake rotor or drum</strong>- Older cars use rear brake drums which utilize brake shoes to stop</li>
     <li><strong>Checking power steering fluid if youre lucky enough to have this luxury</strong>- This is usually found in the engine bay by the steering input shaft</li>
     <li><strong>Purging and refilling zerk fitting points</strong>- This is often overlooked. There are small metal nubs around the suspension components of the car which are used to refill with fresh grease, very important</li>
     <li><strong>Checking brake fluid</strong>- Look for dark color, this indicates its time to change fluid</li>
     <li><strong>Checking parking brake function</strong>- Especially important in manual cars. Always rotate the wheels into the nearest curb when parking, for safety</li>
     <li><strong>Checking battery voltage</strong>- A multi-meter is an extremely useful tool for diagnosing electronic malfunctions, and can be had for very cheap</li>
     <li><strong>Checking blinkers and brake lights</strong>- Note that older cars do not have a third brake light as it was not a requirement</li>
     <li><strong>Checking idle engine speed</strong>- If too low, the engine may die under slight throttle input The engine idle can be adjusted with a small screw on the throttle linkage next to the carburetor, known as the idle speed adjustment screw.
     <li><strong>Checking fuel/air mixture</strong>- If set too rich, spark plugs may foul up, and unburnt fuel will exit into the exhaust and will be noticeably smelly. If too lean, the spark plugs may burn up. Correct fuel/air mixtures protect the spark plugs and engine from excessive heat</li>
     </ul>

     <section id="5" class="tabcontent"><h3>Sport bike projects</h3>
     <p>If you're anything like me, you're constantly broke. So what's better than saving up for a little project car? Saving up
     for a project bike! Sport bikes can be had for as little as $2,000 and can be tons of fun if done right. They are generally
     very fast owing to their low weight and relatively high power-to-weight ratios. They are also far more aerodynamic than road cars.
     If you are looking to get into sport bikes, it is recommended to begin with less powerful sport bikes in the 250-400cc class, however,
     it is difficult to find older used bikes for cheap that have engines smaller than 600cc. This is because the "300cc sport" category is a recent development.
     Most people will begin on a 600cc motor for this reason. For example, the 2005 Yamaha R-6 has 123HP, 50.52 ft/lbs of torque, redlines at 15,500RPM , accelerates from 0-60 in 3.19 seconds and has a 
     power-to-weight ratio of .3135HP per pound. For comparison, The LaFerrari has 788HP, and a power-to-weight ratio of only .2255 HP per pound! This is why
     getting an appropriately powerful beginner bike is so crucial. This is far too much power for a new rider to handle. And an old R6 can be had for less than $4,000.
     Here's my list of manageable 600cc bikes that are plenty of fun to not only work on, but ride as well! Keep in mind that 90's model sportbikes are typically carbureted!</p>
     
     <ul>
     <li><strong>Yamaha YZF600R "Thundercat" (1996-2007)</strong>-This is the first bike I started on. It is a reasonably powerful bike, with 101HP which is actually far more rideable than it sounds. Power delivery is smooth and
     doesn't scare the rider until you rev above 6,000RPM. Older models are carbureted.</li>
     <li><strong>Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R (1995-present)</strong>-This bike is very commonly found on facebook marketplace and is a good starting bike which also produces 100hp.</li>
     <li><strong>Honda CBR600RR (2006-present)</strong>- Honda sportbikes are generally viewed by the public as being reliable and decently powered. Early model years of this bike
     produced 117HP and are decently approachable for new riders</li>
     </ul>

     <p>In general, it is NOT recommended for new riders to jump straight to so-called "liter bikes", which are sport bikes with engine displacements higher than 1000cc.
     From experience, I owned a 1137cc Honda Blackbird which put out 152HP and had a top speed of 195MPH. Way too much power for new riders.</p>

    <section id="6" class="tabcontent"><h3>Sport Bike Maintenance</h3>
    <p>As you may already have guessed, sport bikes have different maintenance requirements than cars. They vary widely from engine design to intended purposes
    just like cars do. Here is a list of important maintenance points for a typical sportbike!</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Inspecting chain/Lubricating chain</strong>-Sportbikes are all chain-driven, and require a special dry lube to protect the chain from high friction.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspecting chain tension</strong>-Sportbikes have chain tensioners located on the swing-arm (Rear control arm). You will need tools to adjust the tension if it is out of specification.</li>
    <li><strong>Syncing carburetors where applicable</strong>-Older carbureted sportbikes have individual carburetors for each cylinder. Typically, sportbikes use 4-cylinder engines. 
    Carburetors must be in sync so each cylinder operates under similar conditions in relation to eachother.(Special syncing equipment is available for this purpose)</li>
    <li><strong>Adjusting throttle cable tension</strong>-Riders have individual preferences for throttle cable tension. This can be adjusted with a wrench and can make the throttle more or less responsive to the rider's wrist motion.</li>
    <li><strong>Checking gas tank for rust</strong>-Small pinhole leaks can develop underneath the gas tank where debris and condensation tend to form. This can lead to small holes which leak gasoline and can cause fires. If you find leaks,
    do not buy a "gas tank leak kit" from an auto parts store. THey do NOT work. Either find a replacement gas tank or attempt to weld a patch to seal the leak.
    <li><strong>Check clutch cable tension</strong>-Clutch levers MUST have a set amount of endplay to function properly. As a rule of thumb, you should be able to stick a penny between the gap in the handle linkage while gently wiggling
    the clutch lever. If the clutch cable is too tight, it will not have any endplay and the clutch may not engage fully, thus resulting in clutch slippage. Adjust the clutch cable by rotating the threaded collar with an adjustable wrench.</li>
    <li><strong>Check oil level</strong> Most sportbikes have a sight glass which allows you to check the oil level from outside the bike. With the kickstand down, gently pull the bike by the handlebar until the bike is perfectly upright. 
    Then observe the oil level in the sight glass. (Sight glasses are typically located towards the bottom of the oil pan)</li>
    </ul>
