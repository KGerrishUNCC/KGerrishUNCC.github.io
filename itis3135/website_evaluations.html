         <p>

         <ul>
         <li> Contrast: The main colors of the website are white, orange, and pine green. The contrast
         elicits a sense of the outdoors and is very pleasing on the eyes. Teal is also used to accent
         some of the highlighted clothing products.</li>
         
         <li>Repetition: Fonts, colors, and size of text and pictures is consistent. Orange font is used as an
         eye-catching sales color consistently.</li>
         
         <li>Alignment: The alignment of tabs, image aspect ratios, and images with links are all 
         congruent and pleasing to look at. The borders center all items well, and captions are properly centered.</li>
         
         <li>Proximity: Sales links with images are placed strategically through the site to stimulate user interaction.
         Product categories are grouped well and allow for easy navigation.</li>
         
         </ul>

         <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist Charlotte</a>
         </h3>
         <p>
         Craigslist is an online marketplace for a large variety of different goods. Craigslist began in 1998 in San Francisco and serves
         70 countries globally.
         </p>
         <ul>
         <li> Contrast: The main colors of the website are white and gray. The contrast is mostly suitable as it allows the blue
         hyperlinks and text to stand out, though some headings are displated with a grey color which makes headings appear washed out.</li>
         
         
         <li>Repetition: 3 fonts are used which leads to a jumbled appearance on-screen. 
         There are also some links with a cream-colored background which seems abritrary.</li>
         
         <li>Alignment: The alignment of this website is horrible. The right taskbar does not line up with the top
         edge of the header bar. Some sub-headings for product categories do not line up either. Bottom margin does not match
         top margin size.</li>
         
         <li>Proximity: Everything on this page is smushed together, making navigation difficult. The website does not make use of
         vertical or horizontal space efficiently.</li>
