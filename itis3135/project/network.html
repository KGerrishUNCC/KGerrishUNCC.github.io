        <p class="network">Emily Rodriguez is a friend of mine and freelance Animator, currently working at Awesome, Inc. in Atlanta, GA. We first met in a Public Speaking class at SCAD, and had the pleasure of serving as Art Director for her Senior Capstone film, VIVID during preproduction. She is a fantastic 2D animator with a growing list of credits, and a great resource as I learn both traditional and rigged 2D animation.</p>

        <p class="network">Jenna Zona is one of my Animation professors at SCAD. She is currently teaching my Animation 704: Concept to Production class, which serves as a full breakdown of all of the tools and techniques professional animators use within the ToonBoom Harmony animation software- including the creation of 2D master controller rigs for animation. Next quarter I will take my first Thesis class which is also being taught by Professor Zona.</p>
