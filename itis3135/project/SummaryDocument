Assignment Specifications

My site meets the assignment specifications by utilizing jquery to run a photo and animation gallery.
I use jquery ui to be able to move through the slideshow and select an image at any point. I have
used ajax requests to load information for sections of the professional background page, as well as for HTMLInclusion. 


Accessibility


For accessibility, I have implemented the following:

-H57 (Using language attributes on the html element)
-G61 (Presenting repeated components in the same relative order each time they appear)
-G141 (Organizing a page using headings)
-G91 (Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link)
-G130 (Providing descriptive headings)


Feedback and Overall Project Overview

I recieved feedback for websites outside of my project sites. I have made sure to
change my overall margins to bring text elements closer, fixed a radio button issue,
and made sure that all sites are free of validation errors.

I believe I have closely followed the criteria given to me by my client: Matthew Buttafuoco.
He has asked for a site which can act as a hub for other personal pages as well as give
insight to his professional background, colleagues, and animations. I would like to continue
to add to this page, increasing interactibility along the way.
