	  <p style="text-align:left"><strong>
                I,<a href = "Introduction.htm">Ken D Gerrish</a>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2022, ITIS3135, Web-Based Design  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
            </strong></p>
            <br><p style="text-align:left"><strong>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            </strong></p>
            <br><p style="text-align:left"><strong>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            </strong></p>
            <br><p style="text-align:left"><strong>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
            </strong></p>
